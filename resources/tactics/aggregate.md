# Aggregate


## 4 r√®gles de base

### 1st rule of thumb: Model true invariants as consistency boundaries.

True invariants are those business rules that are speaking of transactional consistency.

Example: Video Game, Two Fighters, Fighter life point 0 and later die. IT's NOT TRUE INVARIANT. If Fighter life point go to 0, he die immediatly. THAT's TRUE INVARIANT.

### 2nd Design small aggregate

### 3rd : Reference other aggregate by identity only
### 4th: Update other aggregate using eventual consitency
